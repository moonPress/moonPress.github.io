            <h3>WHAT IS FIRST ACCESS?</h3>
            <p>
                First Access is our paid alpha program, which includes exclusive features like a private developer forum, access to constant updates, and the chance to help us make the end of the world even more interesting with your feedback.

            <h3>WHY IS SOULS OF THE LABYRINTH ONLY AVAILABLE ON ITCH.IO?</h3>
            <p>
                While we are planning on adding support for many more platforms and services in the future, right now itch.io is the only online store that can handle all of our First Access needs, including automated update deployment, limiting the number of keys that are available, related community features, and the APIs to support and share those things online and in-game. They've been a huge help in getting this program underway! WE LOVE ITCH.IO.
            </p>
            
            <h3>WAIT WHAT THE HECK IS ITCH.IO</h3>
            <p>
               <a href="https://itch.io/">itch.io</a> is an open marketplace for independent digital creators with a focus on independent video games. It’s a platform that enables anyone to sell the content they've created. As a seller we're in charge of how it’s done: we set the price, we run sales, and we design our pages. It’s never necessary to get votes, likes, or follows to get our content approved, and we can make changes to how we distribute our work as frequently as we like. itch.io is also a collection of some of the most unique, interesting, and independent creations you'll find on the web. They're not your typical digital storefront!
